### Hi, my name is Omar 
####  I am a Masters Student in Financial Engineering at EDHEC BS with experiences in Equity Derivatives Trading and Structuring 


My experience includes pricing exotic derivatives, generating trading ideas, risk recycling trades and developing Python-based tools for data analysis, risk management and research projects to support decision making.

I constantly strive to improve my understanding of the markets and sharpen my strategic thinking and risk assessment skills through activities like poker and other analytical pursuits.
