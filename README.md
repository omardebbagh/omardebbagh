### Hi, my name is Omar 
####  I am a Masters Student in Financial Engineering at EDHEC BS with experiences in Equity Derivatives Trading and Structuring 


My experience includes pricing exotic derivatives, generating trading ideas, recycling risk and developing Python-based tools for data analysis, risk management and research projects 
to support decision making.

I enjoy taking on challenging problems and constantly strive to improve my understanding of the markets. In my free time, I sharpen my strategic thinking and risk assessment skills through activities like poker and other analytical pursuits.

Skills: Equity Derivatives/Volatility/Dispersion Trading/Relative Value Strategies/Convertible Bonds Arbitrage/Poker/Sports betting Arbitrage/Python/Machine Learning
